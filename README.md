### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Melih.

Iâ€™m someone who enjoys moving between different worlds â€” economics, technology, and people. My path has taken me from analyzing large-scale financial data to designing AI-driven solutions, and what connects it all is a curiosity for how systems work and how they can be improved.

I thrive in international environments, and keep learning as a constant practice. What drives me is the belief that well-applied science/technology can simplify complexity and open space for more meaningful human work.
